# ArangoDB Search Functionality Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the search functionality available in the ArangoDB integration for the PDF Extractor project. Based on our testing, we've identified which search types are working and which require additional configuration.

## Working Search Types

### 1. Basic Text Search (CONTAINS)
- Using AQL's `CONTAINS()` function to find text matches
- Example:
  ```aql
  FOR doc IN pdf_documents
      FILTER CONTAINS(doc.text, @search_term, true)
      RETURN doc
  ```
- Status: ✅ WORKING

### 2. Fulltext Index Search (FULLTEXT)
- Using ArangoDB's `FULLTEXT()` function with a dedicated fulltext index
- Example:
  ```aql
  FOR doc IN FULLTEXT(pdf_documents, "text", @term)
      RETURN doc
  ```
- Status: ✅ WORKING

### 3. BM25 Search with ArangoSearch View
- Using ArangoSearch view with BM25 ranking
- Example:
  ```aql
  FOR doc IN pdf_documents_view
      SEARCH ANALYZER(doc.text, "text_en") LIKE @term
      SORT BM25(doc) DESC
      RETURN doc
  ```
- Status: ✅ WORKING (with properly configured view)

## Search Types Requiring Configuration

### 4. Vector-based Semantic Search
- Current status: ⚠️ PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED
- Issues identified:
  - Vector index can be created, but `VECTOR_DISTANCE()` function appears to be unavailable
  - Current ArangoDB instance may not have the vector search feature fully enabled

### 5. Hybrid Search (BM25 + Semantic)
- Current status: ⚠️ DEPENDS ON SEMANTIC SEARCH
- Since hybrid search combines BM25 and semantic search, it requires semantic search to be functioning

## Implementation Details

### Collection Setup
- Collection: `pdf_documents`
- Required indexes:
  - Fulltext index on `text` field
  - Hash index on `type` field
  - Hash index on `file_path` field
  - Skiplist index on `page` field

### ArangoSearch View Setup
```javascript
{
  "type": "arangosearch",
  "links": {
    "pdf_documents": {
      "includeAllFields": false,
      "fields": {
        "text": {
          "analyzers": ["text_en"]
        },
        "type": {},
        "file_path": {},
        "page": {}
      },
      "analyzers": ["identity", "text_en"]
    }
  },
  "commitIntervalMsec": 1000
}
```

## Recommendations

1. Basic text search, fulltext search, and BM25 search are fully functional and can be used in the PDF Extractor project.

2. For vector-based semantic search and hybrid search, the following steps are required:
   - Ensure ArangoDB is running with the `--experimental-vector-index` flag enabled
   - Verify that the `VECTOR_DISTANCE()` function is available in the current ArangoDB version
   - Configure proper vector indexes on the `embedding` field

3. Until semantic search is fully configured, the PDF Extractor project should rely on the working search types for document retrieval.

## Test Results

Our testing confirms that:
- Documents can be stored in ArangoDB with all required fields
- Basic text search works correctly using CONTAINS
- Fulltext search works correctly using the FULLTEXT index
- BM25 search works correctly with a properly configured ArangoSearch view
- Vector index can be created, but vector distance calculation is not available in the current setup

The ArangoDB integration provides a solid foundation for storing and retrieving PDF extraction results with robust search capabilities.
