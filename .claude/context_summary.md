# Project Status Summary

## Completed Work

We have successfully implemented and integrated an improved table merger into the PDF extractor project. This component enhances the table extraction capabilities by intelligently detecting and merging tables that span multiple pages.

### Implementation Details:
1. **Improved Table Merger Implementation**:
   - Created  with three configurable merge strategies:
     - : Only merges tables with high similarity (default)
     - : Merges tables with more relaxed similarity requirements
     - : Disables merging functionality
   - Added enhanced header detection that works with slight header variations
   - Implemented sophisticated similarity calculation using multiple metrics
   - Added comprehensive validation tests for all merge strategies

2. **Table Extractor Integration**:
   - Updated  to use the improved table merger
   - Added a  parameter to the  class
   - Made the system robust by handling both camelot table objects and dictionaries

3. **Testing and Validation**:
   - Created test scripts to verify the functionality
   - Validated all merge strategies produce expected outputs
   - Confirmed the integration works correctly

### Key Features:
- **Robust Header Matching**: Intelligently matches headers even with minor variations
- **Configurable Strategies**: Different merging approaches for different document types
- **Data Integrity**: Safe merging operations with validation to prevent data corruption
- **Diagnostic Logging**: Detailed logging for troubleshooting and monitoring

### Project Organization:
- Implementation code: 
- Integration: 
- Tests: 
- Documentation: 

## Next Steps
1. Further testing with complex, real-world PDFs
2. Add more examples to the documentation
3. Consider adding more merge strategy options if needed
4. Possibly optimize performance for large documents

The implementation follows the project's core principles, particularly the 95/5 rule (95% package functionality, 5% customization) and prioritizes functionality with thorough validation.
