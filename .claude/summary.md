# PDF Extractor - Project Complete

The project has been successfully organized and the improved table merger has been implemented and tested. Main accomplishments:

1. Implemented improved_table_merger.py with three strategies (conservative, aggressive, none)
2. Integrated with table_extractor.py via merge_strategy parameter
3. Organized project with proper directory structure
4. Added tests that verify correct functionality
5. Created documentation in docs directory

Tests confirm that the improved table merger works as expected:

- Conservative & Aggressive strategies: Successfully merge tables with appropriate criteria
- None strategy: Keeps tables separate as expected

Next steps should include testing with real PDFs and extending documentation.
