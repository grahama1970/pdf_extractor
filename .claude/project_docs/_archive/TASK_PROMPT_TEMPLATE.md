You MUST follow the GUIDELINES. 
We are working on this plan/task list:
{/home/graham/workspace/experiments/pdf_extractor/task.md}

So far we've done tasks {task}

The next task on our list is to implement {subtask 4.1.}
Please proceed with the next sub-task in {/home/graham/workspace/experiments/pdf_extractor/task.md} (4.1 Create _get_processed_schema function to fetch schema from the API)

Always Follow CODE_STANDARDS when writing code and if stuck in errors or unsure about solution/methon/implementation, please ask perplexity. But make sure to generate a variety of potential search keywords to use and run them all not just a single one.
