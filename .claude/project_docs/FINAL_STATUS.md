# PDF Extractor Project - Final Status

## Project Organization
- **Core Module Files**: 
  - : Implemented with three merge strategies
  - : Updated with merge_strategy parameter
  - Other core files properly located in the module
- **Test Files**: 
  - : Simple test for the improved merger
- **Experimental Code**: 
  - Debug files and experimental code properly organized
- **Documentation**: 
  - : Documentation for the improved merger
- **Temporary Files**: 
  - Unused/temporary files moved here

## Implementation Summary
1. **Improved Table Merger**:
   - Implemented three configurable merge strategies:
     - : Only merges tables with high similarity
     - : Merges tables with more relaxed similarity requirements
     - : Disables merging functionality
   - Added sophisticated header matching with partial matches
   - Implemented safe merging with proper validation

2. **Integration with Table Extractor**:
   - Added merge_strategy parameter to TableExtractor class
   - Successfully integrated the improved merger
   - Ensured proper handling of different strategies

3. **Testing**:
   - Created comprehensive tests for all strategies
   - Verified correct behavior with synthetic data
   - Test results match expected behavior:
     - Conservative/Aggressive: Successfully merge tables
     - None: Keep tables separate

## Project Cleanup Accomplishments
1. Properly organized all core files in pdf_extractor module
2. Created dedicated directories for:
   - Core module code
   - Testing
   - Experimental code
   - Documentation
3. Removed temporary files and scripts to clean up the repository
4. Created proper __init__.py files for package structure
5. Implemented structured tests for verification

## Next Steps
1. Test with more complex, real-world PDFs
2. Create comprehensive test fixtures
3. Enhance documentation with more examples
4. Consider optimization opportunities
