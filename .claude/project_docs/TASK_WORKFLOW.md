# TASK WORKFLOW
> Structured approach for task implementation and tracking

## Task Implementation Process
1. **Focus on one sub-task at a time**
   - Complete current sub-task before starting next
   - Get explicit user approval before proceeding

2. **Task Progress Tracking**
   - Mark completed sub-tasks: [ ] â†’ [x]
   - Mark parent task as complete when all sub-tasks are done
   - Update "Relevant Files" section with any modified PDF processing components

3. **Implementation Sequence**
   - Verify PDF extraction requirements and context
   - Implement according to CODE_STANDARDS
   - Test with sample PDFs from src/input directory
   - Update task list and wait for approval

## Tools & Resources
- Second-guess assumptions about PDF structure
- Use search tools for PDF extraction techniques
- Utilize code exploration tools to understand existing extractors
- Reference existing parsers before implementing new extraction logic
