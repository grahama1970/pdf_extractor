# PDF Extractor - Project Summary

## Current Status

We've successfully implemented and integrated an improved table merger module with the following features:

1. **Three Configurable Merge Strategies**:
   - : Only merges tables with high similarity (80% threshold)
   - : Merges tables with lower similarity requirements (60% threshold)
   - : Disables merging functionality

2. **Key Features**:
   - Smart header detection that works with variations in formatting
   - Proper handling of multi-page tables
   - Safe merging with comprehensive validation
   - Detailed logging for troubleshooting

3. **Integration**:
   - Integrated with table_extractor.py via merge_strategy parameter
   - Works seamlessly with the existing extraction pipeline
   - Comprehensive tests verify functionality

## Directory Organization

The project now follows a clean structure with all files properly organized:

- Core files in src/pdf_extractor/
- Test files in src/pdf_extractor/test/
- Experimental code in src/pdf_extractor/experiments/
- Documentation in docs/
- Temporary files in .temp/

DO NOT add files directly to the src/ directory - always use the appropriate subdirectory!

## Next Steps

1. Test with complex, real-world PDFs from src/input/
2. Create comprehensive test fixtures
3. Enhance documentation with more examples
4. Integrate with the complete PDF extraction pipeline
