# Project Status - PDF Extractor

## Project Organization

The project has been properly organized with the following structure:

- src/pdf_extractor/ - Core module files
- src/pdf_extractor/experiments/ - Experimental and debug scripts
- src/pdf_extractor/test/ - Test files
- docs/ - Documentation
- .temp/ - Temporary files

## Implementation Status

1. Improved Table Merger:
   - Created improved_table_merger.py with three configurable strategies
   - Implemented smart header matching with fuzzy logic
   - Added validation for safe merging operations

2. Integration:
   - Updated table_extractor.py to use the improved merger
   - Added merge_strategy parameter for configuration
   - Ensured backward compatibility

3. Testing:
   - Created simple test script in test directory
   - Verified functionality with synthetic data
   - Confirmed correct behavior for all strategies

## Next Steps

1. Testing with Real PDFs:
   - Test with documents from src/input directory
   - Create test fixtures with expected outputs
   - Validate all merge strategies with complex documents

2. Documentation Enhancement:
   - Add code examples for different use cases
   - Include performance considerations
   - Document integration approaches
